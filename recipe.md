INSTRUCTIONS
 
Empty soy milk in a saucepan and bring to a low pre boil (taking care it doesn’t boil over) for 5 minutes and then remove from the heat and let it cool to 80° - 90° C degrees (if you don’t have a thermometer just leave the milk to sit 1 minute off the head and it should be approx 80 -90 C) Remove any skin that forms.
Juice the lemon and collect the juice in a bowl. Remove any seeds.
Curdle the milk by adding lemon juice bit by bit with a ladle to the hot soy milk in the sauce pan.
Stir well and allow the juice to curdle the milk well.
When you stir, the soy milk should look completely curdled with separated transparent soy whey and thicker white soy protein.
Place a large piece of cheesecloth over a large mesh strainer over a large bowl. Pour the curdled milk slowly into the cheesecloth.
Now squeeze the tofu in the cheesecloth gently to drain excess water. Leaving you with just the tofu.
Wrap the tofu in cheesecloth in a square container that has hole to let the water/whey drain place some weight on it, to help it drain further. Place in the fridge.
After 1 hours being weighed down. Silken tofu is ready.
After 3-4 hours weighed down you will have a firmer tofu.
Make sure to soak the tofu in clean cold water before eating so it is not bitter. Use it for all your favourite tofu dishes, Enjoy!
